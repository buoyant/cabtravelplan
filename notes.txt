Plan of Action:

  1. how to pick location from latitude and longitude
  2. how to connect lat and lon to create a route path
  3. starting point will be office - lat & lon
  4. output will be two sheets
      a. employee plan - empl details
      b. cost plan - vehicle details
  5.create algo to make path

  * The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it   is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles.
  * create a ruby program that will accept csv and generate two csv
  * As per data given, we already have lat and long details of employees. we dont need any third party api for getting lat and long from address.
if needed we can use geokit library to retrieve lat and lon from address

Approach / Solution steps:
    1. calculate distance of each employee from others.
    2. we calculated with a range of 3 kms radius.
    3. we grouped all nearest employees after excluding the ones which are already been grouped.
    4. we sorted each group employee on basis of distance from office.
    5. we segregated these groups into vehicle trips by type of vehicle (according to capacity allowed) and the distance to be traveled.
    6. Assigning trips to vehicles as per availability.
    7. calculate the cost from no.of trips of each vehicle and distance traveled (which is calculated in point 5).
    8. vehicle assignation has done in zig zag format (sooner finished the trip -> assigned a new trip).
  
Points taken care:
  travel plan gets refreshed everytime to avoid employees who are on leave.
  travel plan gets refreshed when any new employee joined.
  application can prepare travel from csv as well as database.
  Lat and Lon can also be extracted within the app from address provided.
